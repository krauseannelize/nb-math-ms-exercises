## Exercise 3

Imagine you need to create a 4-character password using distinct digits from 0 to 9. In how many ways can you do it given that you can use each digit only once (no repetitions)?

$P(n,r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$  
$P(10,4) = \frac{10!}{(10-4)!} = \frac{10!}{6!} = 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 = 5040$
